**AI Image Renamer** is a command-line tool that leverages generative artificial intelligence to intelligently rename your image files based on their content. This helps in organizing your photo collection by giving images more descriptive and searchable filenames. A [free Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) is required for this project. **For a full documentation of this tool, please visit the [official documentation**](https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/ai-image-renamer).

## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è**Speed:** Groq's fast infrastructure processes your files in milliseconds
- üîé **SEO:** Generated file names are [SEO-friendly](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide)
- üìö **Batch:** Use one or multiple image files within a single command
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Easy:** Renaming files requires only a single command line

## Installation

*AI Image Renamer* is [hosted on the PyPi.org repository](https://pypi.org/project/ai-image-renamer/).

1. In an isolated environment, you can use `pip` to install the command for that specific environment:

   ```bash
   pip install ai-image-renamer
   ```

   However, if you'd like to have the command accessible system-wide, [see here](https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/ai-image-renamer/usage/installation#install-system-wide).

2. Get your [free API key on console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys) and set it as an environment variable in  your user's `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, or whichever you use:

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="..."
   ```

## Usage

The `rename-images` command is your entry point to the tool. However, since it's using [Groq and Meta's Llama 4 Maverick](https://console.groq.com/docs/vision) model, some limitations apply:

### Basic Usage

To rename a single image:

```bash
rename-images path/to/your/image.jpg
```

To rename multiple images:

```bash
rename-images image1.png image2.jpg path/to/another/image.webp
```

To rename an image with only 3 words:

```bash
rename-images -w 3 DSC_123.jpg
```

See `rename-images -h` for more options or read about them in the [documentation](https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/ai-image-renamer/usage/options).
