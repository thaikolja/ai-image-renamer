# AI Image Renamer

**AI Image Renamer** is a Python package that uses **Groq's free API** to rename one or more image files. It uses the latest open-source LLMs to accurately analyze your images and rename them based on what is in the image in an SEO-friendly way.

As an example, a file named `b19a8c45-9e29-4048-aae7.webp` that shows a woman sitting in her living room reading a book will then be renamed to `female-reading-a-book-in-living-room.web` (depending on the settings, the names will always slightly differ).

> This project is still in progress and will be merged from `dev` to `main` once it reaches `v1.0.0`. When it's released and available on PyPi to install it via `pip`, this `REAMDE.md` will contain only a very brief installation and usage guide. For a thorough documentation of this CLI tool, visit https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/ai-image-renamer.
